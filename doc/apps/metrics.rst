This app adds a number of item attributes that make it
easy to identify critical areas in the plan.

For every **item** we capture:

- count of late demands
- quantity of late demands
- value of late demands
- count of unplanned demands
- quantity of unplanned demands
- value of unplanned demands

For every **resource** we capture:

- count of capacity overload problems

The app also defines a **delivery performance widget** on the home screen.
